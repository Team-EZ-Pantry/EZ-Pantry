## 1. Overview

[cite_start]EZ Pantry is a time-saving application designed to transform kitchen management[cite: 5]. [cite_start]It serves as an all-in-one solution for smarter and faster food preparation [cite: 6] [cite_start]by keeping your ingredients, recipes, and plans in one place[cite: 2, 3]. [cite_start]The initial application will be built as a frontend application in Flutter for Android[cite: 97].

## 2. Core Features (Minimum Viable Product)

[cite_start]The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on the essential functionalities for pantry management[cite: 20].

* [cite_start]**User Login Page** [cite: 21]
    * [cite_start]Provides personal and secure access to the application[cite: 22].
    * [cite_start]Ties the user's digital pantry to their specific account[cite: 23].
* [cite_start]**Manual Item Entry** [cite: 24]
    * [cite_start]Allows users to effortlessly enter custom items into their virtual pantry[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]**Inventory Tracking** [cite: 26]
    * [cite_start]Enables users to monitor the quantity of items and their expiration dates[cite: 27].

## 3. Future Features

[cite_start]Following the MVP, these features are planned for future development[cite: 28, 51].

* [cite_start]**Barcode Scanning** [cite: 29][cite_start]: Quickly add products to your virtual pantry by scanning barcodes with your phone[cite: 31].
* [cite_start]**Meal Planning** [cite: 32][cite_start]: Plan future meals based on the food items available in the pantry[cite: 34].

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

The project's success will be measured by its adherence to the following quality standards.

* [cite_start]**User Experience and Usability** [cite: 63]
    * [cite_start]The application must have a responsive and intuitive interface[cite: 64].
    * [cite_start]It should require minimal onboarding for new users[cite: 65].
* [cite_start]**Technical Quality** [cite: 66]
    * [cite_start]The codebase must be scalable, maintainable, and cohesive[cite: 67].
    * [cite_start]The system must protect user data[cite: 68].
    * [cite_start]It must effectively handle a realistic volume of data without performance issues[cite: 69].

## 5. Technical Stack

The following technologies will be used to build the application.

* [cite_start]**Frontend**: The application will be a **Flutter** app built for **Android**[cite: 97]. [cite_start]Flutter is an open-source framework for building natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase[cite: 98].
* [cite_start]**Backend**: A **Node.js** Backend API will be used[cite: 100].
    * [cite_start]**Why Node.js?**: It is simple to learn, widely used for APIs, and efficient[cite: 107].
* [cite_start]**Database**: A **PostgreSQL** database will store application data[cite: 102].
    * [cite_start]**Why PostgreSQL?**: It supports structured data and relationships, is widely used, and is open-source and free[cite: 109].
* [cite_start]**Hosting**: The backend and database will be hosted on **Render**[cite: 103, 104].
    * [cite_start]**Why Render?**: It is a full app hosting platform that manages Postgres without extra setup and is scalable[cite: 110].
* [cite_start]**Version Control**: **GitHub** will be used for version control[cite: 17].
    * [cite_start]Issues, issue boards, and milestones will keep the project organized[cite: 18].
    * [cite_start]Merge requests will be used for code accountability[cite: 19].
