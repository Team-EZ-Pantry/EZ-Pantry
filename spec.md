## EZ Pantry App: Design Specification

This document outlines the design, requirements, and technical specifications for the EZ Pantry mobile application, based on the project presentation.

---

### 1. Overview

EZ Pantry is a time-saving application designed to transform kitchen management. It serves as an **all-in-one solution** for smarter and faster food preparation by keeping your ingredients, recipes, and plans in one place. The initial application will be built as a frontend application in **Flutter** for **Android**.

---

### 2. Core Features (Minimum Viable Product)

The **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** will focus on the essential functionalities for pantry management.

* **User Login Page**: Provides personal and secure access to the application and ties the user's digital pantry to their specific account.
* **Manual Item Entry**: Allows users to effortlessly enter custom items into their virtual pantry.
* **Inventory Tracking**: Enables users to monitor the quantity of items and their expiration dates.

---

### 3. Future Features

Following the MVP, these features are planned for future development.

* **Barcode Scanning**: Quickly add products to your virtual pantry by scanning barcodes with your phone.
* **Meal Planning**: Plan future meals based on the food items available in the pantry.
* **Personal Recipe Collection**: Save your personal recipes for later use.
* **LLM Integration to suggest recipes**
* **Ingredient expiration alerts**

---

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

The project's success will be measured by its adherence to the following quality standards.

* **User Experience and Usability**: The application must have a responsive and intuitive interface that requires minimal onboarding for new users.
* **Technical Quality**: The codebase must be scalable, maintainable, and cohesive. The system must protect user data and effectively handle a realistic volume of data without performance issues.

---

### 5. Technical Stack

The following technologies will be used to build the application.

* **Frontend**: The application will be a **Flutter** app built for **Android**. Flutter is an open-source framework for building natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.
* **Backend**: A **Node.js** Backend API will be used because it is simple to learn, widely used for APIs, and efficient.
* **Database**: A **PostgreSQL** database will store application data because it supports structured data, is widely used, and is open-source.
* **Hosting**: The backend and database will be hosted on **Render** because it is a full app hosting platform that is scalable and manages Postgres without extra setup.
* **Version Control**: **GitHub** will be used for version control. Issues, milestones, and merge requests will keep the project organized and provide accountability.
